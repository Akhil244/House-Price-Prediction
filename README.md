# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on various features using regression models. This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to achieve accurate predictions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The aim is to predict the sale price of houses based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and more. We use machine learning models including **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, and **Ridge Regression** to make predictions.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## 🔎 Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier Removal
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training with:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
- Model Evaluation using R² Score and Cross-Validation
- Model Saving with Pickle

## 📈 Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression** - baseline model.
- **Lasso Regression** - to perform feature selection and prevent overfitting.
- **Ridge Regression** - to handle multicollinearity and improve generalization.
